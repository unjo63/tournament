# P2 final project: Tournament Planner
In this project, I have written a Python module that uses the PostgreSQL database to keep track of players and matches 
in a game tournament.

The game tournament will use the Swiss system for pairing up players in each round: players are not eliminated, 
and each player should be paired with another player with the same number of wins, or as close as possible.

This project has two parts: defining the database schema (SQL table definitions), and writing the code that will use it.
